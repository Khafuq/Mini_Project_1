## Exploring and Cleaning:
1- Missing values and duplicate rows 
2- Data types
3- Inconsistent Values

## Statistics & Visualization:

1- Statistics of each columns

2- Visualizations of important columns 

3- Visualizations of related columns

## Research Questions:
vHow effective is the test preparation course (e.g. TestPrep, ParentEdu, etc.)?
vWhat factors (features) affect test scores most?
What would be the best way to improve student scores on
each test?
What patterns and interactions in the data can you find?
