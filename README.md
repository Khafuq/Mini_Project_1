2- Data types

3- Inconsistent Values

### Statistics & Visualization:

1- Statistics of each columns

2- Visualizations of important columns 

3- Visualizations of related columns

### Research Questions:
1- How effective is the test preparation course (e.g. TestPrep, ParentEdu, etc.)?

2- What factors (features) affect test scores most?

3- What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test?

4- What patterns and interactions in the data can you find?
